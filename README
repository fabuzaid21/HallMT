RULES:
1. 'Al' + Infinitive
When we have 'al', which translates to 'to the', plus an infinitive, we change it to 'upon'. For instance, "to noting that the" => "upon noting that the". 

2. A Vs. An
If we have a translation to 'an' when 'a' is supposed to be used, switch it, and vice versa. Spanish doesn't have For instance, "an witch" => "a witch".

3. Double Negative
If negative words such as 'nothing', 'never', 'no', and 'nobody' are negated once more with 'not', we switch them to the positive word such as 'anything', 'always', 'some', and 'somebody'. 

For each rule you create, a description of what it was supposed to do, what differences between Language F and English it was supposed to fix. Make sure you give a good example of the use of the rules in your running of your code.

OTHER FEATURES:
We implemented a three-word phrase stupid-backoff model, meaning that it first looks for phrases of three words in the dictionary, then two, then one word. This allows for correct translation of phrases such as "sin embargo" to "however".

ERROR ANALYSIS:
What kinds of errors are still left, and what kind of knowledge would you have needed to fix them?
Error analysis, including ideas for how additional work might fix your remaining errors.

COMPARISON TO GOOGLE TRANSLATE:
Both our system Google Translate fail to address gender and often mix up subject pronouns, switching "it" or "he" for "her" and "she". Google is  more fluent than our system, and longer sentences tend to sound better. Our translator, due to its direct translation model, is more faithful than fluent. Thus, it has a better translation in shorter sentences with less context, such as "Le llevó al establo y le encerró detrás de una reja" translated to "He took him to the barn and locked him behind a grid", whereas Google results in "It took the barn and locked behind a fence".

==========================================================================

MAIN OBSERVATIONS ABOUT SPANISH:
1. Many sentences are missing a subject.
2. Words often translate to -ing forms followed by nouns, such as "lo celebraba comiéndoselos" translates to "celebrating eating it them", which makes for ambiguous objects in relation to the -ing verb.  
3. Adjectives follow nouns, but in English nouns follow adjective.
4. Not all prepositions match up to English equivalents. For example, "demanded him" or "demanded from him" is ambiguous. Mainly, the Spanish 'a' complicates prepositional translations, since "Tras despertar a Gretel a grito" can translate directly to "After awakening to Gretel to shouting", but should be "After awakening to Gretel shouting".
